# 🛒 Retail Profitability Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze transactional retail data to uncover profit-draining categories, optimize inventory turnover, and identify seasonal product behavior.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project combines **SQL**, **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)**, and **Tableau** to explore and visualize key profitability patterns across products, regions, and time.  

The primary business questions addressed include:
- Which product categories are draining profits?
- Which items are overstocked or slow-moving?
- What are the seasonal sales trends?
- Which regions/stores are performing best?

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, joins, and profit margin calculations  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** – Correlation analysis and exploratory metrics  
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards for strategic insight

## 📊 Key Dashboards in Tableau
- **Profit-Draining Categories** – Bar chart showing least profitable product types  
- **Inventory Turnover Optimization** – Scatter plot showing stock vs revenue  
- **Seasonal Sales Trends** – Line chart showing monthly profit patterns  
- **Regional Performance** – Bar chart showing profit by store location  

## 💡 Key Insights
- Overstocked products like **Games** and **Art & Crafts** have low turnover ratios, despite being profitable.
- **March to July** is the high-profit season; **October and November** show low demand.
- **Cuidad de Mexico** leads regional profit, followed by **Guadalajara** and **Monterrey**.

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations
- Reduce restocking for slow-moving items
- Realign procurement with seasonal demand
- Optimize inventory distribution by region
- Use bundling and discounts to clear overstock
